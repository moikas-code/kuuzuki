# UI Polish and Missing Features Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementing final UI polish and missing features from OpenCode analysis to achieve production-ready user experience.

## 1. Enhanced File Attachment Handling

### Current State Analysis
- Basic attachment structure exists in `packages/tui/internal/attachment/attachment.go`
- Web interface has file attachment display in `packages/web/src/components/share/part.tsx`
- TUI has attachment handling but needs enhancement

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Enhance file attachment conversion features
- [ ] Improve attachment preview and display
- [ ] Add better file type detection and icons
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop attachment support
- [ ] Add attachment size limits and validation

## 2. Enhanced Message Layout and Styling

### Current State Analysis
- Message rendering in `packages/tui/internal/components/chat/message.go`
- Web message layout in `packages/web/src/components/Share.tsx`
- Basic styling exists but needs consistency improvements

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Improve message spacing and padding
- [ ] Enhance message borders and visual separation
- [ ] Add better typography and text rendering
- [ ] Implement consistent color schemes
- [ ] Add message status indicators

## 3. Better Error Message Display

### Current State Analysis
- Error handling exists in toast system and message rendering
- Basic error formatting in place
- Needs enhancement for better user experience

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Enhance error message formatting
- [ ] Add error categorization and icons
- [ ] Implement error recovery suggestions
- [ ] Add better error context and details
- [ ] Improve error message positioning

## 4. Enhanced Tool Output Formatting

### Current State Analysis
- Tool output rendering in message.go and part.tsx
- Basic tool visualization exists
- Streaming indicators partially implemented

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Enhance tool output visualization
- [ ] Add better progress indicators
- [ ] Implement collapsible tool sections
- [ ] Add tool execution timing display
- [ ] Improve tool result formatting

## 5. UI Consistency Improvements

### Current State Analysis
- Theme system exists in `packages/tui/internal/theme/`
- Web and TUI have different styling approaches
- Need cross-platform consistency

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Standardize color schemes across platforms
- [ ] Unify spacing and layout patterns
- [ ] Implement consistent component styling
- [ ] Add responsive design improvements
- [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance

## 6. Additional Polish Features

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Add smooth animations and transitions
- [ ] Implement better loading states
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts and navigation
- [ ] Enhance copy-to-clipboard functionality
- [ ] Add better scroll behavior and indicators

## Implementation Priority
1. Enhanced error message display (critical for UX)
2. Tool output formatting improvements (high impact)
3. Message layout and styling (visual consistency)
4. File attachment enhancements (feature completeness)
5. Cross-platform UI consistency (polish)
6. Additional polish features (nice-to-have)

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test all UI improvements in TUI
- [ ] Test web interface consistency
- [ ] Verify error handling scenarios
- [ ] Test file attachment workflows
- [ ] Validate cross-platform consistency
- [ ] Performance testing for UI responsiveness
