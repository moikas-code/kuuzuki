# Context Fix Summary

## Overview
This branch implements a simplified context management system to fix the issue where the assistant couldn't remember previous messages in a conversation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Complex Context Management (Commit: b86ebda8)
- Deleted 12,000+ lines of complex code:
  - `hybrid-context-manager.ts`
  - `hybrid-context-config.ts` 
  - `hybrid-context.ts`
  - `task-aware-compression.ts`
  - `integrated-context-manager.ts`
  - `improved-context-manager.ts`
  - `message-loader.ts`
  - And related test files

### 2. Implemented Simple Direct Loading
- Modified `session/index.ts` to use direct message loading similar to OpenCode
- Messages are now loaded directly from storage without complex caching layers
- Simplified the `messages()` function to return messages directly

### 3. Added Security Fixes
- **Share Secret Validation**: Prevents empty or invalid share secrets
- **ID Validation**: Added `validateSessionID()` and `validateMessageID()` to prevent path traversal attacks
- Created new `util/id-validation.ts` module

### 4. Fixed Syntax Errors
- Resolved brace mismatches in `session/index.ts`
- Fixed function scoping issues
- Corrected namespace structure

## Current Status

### Completed ✅
- Reverted to simple implementation based on commit 3fdfebb6
- Removed all complex context management code
- Implemented security fixes
- Fixed TypeScript syntax errors
- Code is syntactically correct
- Added TypeScript compilation workaround
- **Verified context persistence works correctly** with test script

### Partially Blocked ⚠️
- Direct Bun execution blocked by v1.2.19 namespace bug
- Error: "Top-level return cannot be used inside an ECMAScript module"
- Workaround implemented: TypeScript compilation to JavaScript
- Context persistence verified to work with simplified implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Option A**: Wait for Bun fix or try different Bun version
2. ✅ **Option B**: Add TypeScript compilation step to generate JavaScript (IMPLEMENTED)
3. **Option C**: Refactor from namespace to ES modules (major change)
4. **Option D**: Test with alternative runtime (Node.js with tsx)

### Bun API Investigation Results

We explored using Bun's own APIs to handle the namespace issue:
- **Bun.build() API**: Failed with same namespace error
- **Bun CLI bundling**: Failed with same namespace error  
- **Bun --compile**: Failed with same namespace error
- **Custom plugins**: Cannot be applied due to bundler failure

**Conclusion**: This is a fundamental bug in Bun v1.2.19's TypeScript namespace handling that affects all compilation modes. The TypeScript-to-JavaScript compilation workaround remains the only viable solution.

## Test Results

A test script was created and run successfully, confirming that:
1. Messages are stored correctly in the file system
2. Messages are retrieved in the correct order
3. Context is maintained between messages
4. No complex caching is needed - direct file system access works

### How to Test Manually

When the Bun issue is resolved or using the compiled version:
1. Start the server: `bun dev` or `npm run build && ./bin/kuuzuki.js serve`
2. Create a new session
3. Send a message asking to write a poem
4. Send a follow-up message asking about the poem
5. Verify the assistant remembers the previous context

## Key Insight
The original v0.1.16 implementation was overly complex. The simple approach used by OpenCode (direct storage reads without caching) should be sufficient for maintaining context between messages.
