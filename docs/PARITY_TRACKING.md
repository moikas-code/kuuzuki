# Fork Parity Tracking System

This document outlines how kuuzuki tracks parity with the upstream OpenCode repository.

## Overview

Kuuzuki maintains a sophisticated parity tracking system to:
- Monitor upstream changes and their integration status
- Track kuuzuki-specific enhancements beyond upstream
- Provide visibility into what features are missing, integrated, or enhanced
- Automate parity status updates and reporting

## Tracking Structure

### 1. Parity Status Database
Location: `.fork-parity/parity.db` (SQLite database)

Contains:
- Commit analysis and categorization
- Integration status tracking
- Conflict risk assessment
- Effort estimates

### 2. Knowledge Base Integration
Location: `kb/active/` directory

Key files:
- `opencode-parity-status.md` - Current parity overview
- `opencode-parity-summary.md` - Executive summary
- `fresh-parity-audit-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Audit reports
- `auth-comparison-analysis.md` - Feature-specific analysis

### 3. Automated Reports
Location: `.fork-parity-reports/` directory

Generated reports:
- Daily parity dashboards
- Critical commit alerts
- Integration progress tracking
- Conflict analysis reports

## Parity Status Categories

### ‚úÖ Integrated
Features that have been successfully integrated from upstream.

### üöÄ Enhanced
Features where kuuzuki has superior implementation compared to upstream.

### ‚ùå Missing
Upstream features not yet integrated into kuuzuki.

### üö´ Not Applicable
Upstream changes that don't apply to kuuzuki (e.g., SST-specific infrastructure).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Review
Changes that require evaluation to determine integration approach.

## Tracking Workflow

### 1. Automated Monitoring
- Daily sync with upstream repository
- Automatic commit analysis and categorization
- Risk assessment and effort estimation
- Alert generation for critical changes

### 2. Manual Review Process
- Weekly parity review meetings
- Feature-specific deep-dive analysis
- Integration planning and prioritization
- Documentation updates

### 3. Integration Tracking
- Pre-integration analysis
- Implementation progress tracking
- Post-integration verification
- Status updates in knowledge base

## Tools and Commands

### Fork Parity MCP Server
```bash
# Get current parity status
fork-parity status

# Generate comprehensive dashboard
fork-parity dashboard

# Analyze specific commits
fork-parity analyze <commit-hash>

# Create integration plan
fork-parity plan

# Update commit status
fork-parity update <commit-hash> --status integrated
```

### Knowledge Base Commands
```bash
# Read current parity status
kb_read active/opencode-parity-status.md

# Search for specific features
kb_search "authentication"

# Update parity documentation
kb_update active/parity-analysis.md
```

## Integration Guidelines

### Before Integration
1. **Analyze Impact**: Use fork-parity tools to assess changes
2. **Check Existing**: Verify if feature already exists in kuuzuki
3. **Evaluate Necessity**: Determine if change applies to kuuzuki
4. **Plan Implementation**: Create integration strategy

### During Integration
1. **Track Progress**: Update parity database with status
2. **Document Changes**: Record decisions and modifications
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure integration doesn't break existing features
4. **Update Documentation**: Reflect changes in knowledge base

### After Integration
1. **Mark Complete**: Update parity status to "integrated"
2. **Document Enhancements**: Note any kuuzuki-specific improvements
3. **Update Tests**: Ensure test coverage for new features
4. **Generate Reports**: Update parity dashboards

## Reporting and Visibility

### Daily Reports
- Automated parity dashboard generation
- Critical commit alerts
- Integration progress updates

### Weekly Summaries
- Comprehensive parity analysis
- Feature comparison reports
- Integration roadmap updates

### Monthly Reviews
- Strategic parity assessment
- Long-term integration planning
- Architecture alignment review

## Best Practices

### 1. Proactive Monitoring
- Set up automated alerts for critical upstream changes
- Regular review of parity status
- Early identification of breaking changes

### 2. Selective Integration
- Focus on features that benefit kuuzuki users
- Avoid unnecessary complexity from upstream
- Maintain kuuzuki's unique identity and advantages

### 3. Documentation First
- Document analysis before implementation
- Track decision rationale
- Maintain historical context

### 4. Quality Over Speed
- Thorough analysis before integration
- Comprehensive testing
- User impact assessment

## Automation Setup

### GitHub Actions
- Daily parity sync and analysis
- Automated report generation
- Critical change notifications
- Integration status updates

### MCP Integration
- Real-time parity queries
- Automated commit analysis
- Integration planning assistance
- Status tracking and reporting

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Weekly parity review
- Monthly deep-dive analysis
- Quarterly strategic assessment
- Annual architecture review

### Database Maintenance
- Regular backup of parity database
- Performance optimization
- Data cleanup and archival
- Schema updates as needed

## Getting Started

### For Developers
1. Install fork-parity MCP server
2. Review current parity status: `kb_read active/opencode-parity-status.md`
3. Check for assigned integration tasks
4. Follow integration workflow

### For Maintainers
1. Set up automated monitoring
2. Configure notification channels
3. Establish review schedules
4. Train team on parity processes

This system ensures kuuzuki maintains strategic alignment with upstream while preserving its unique advantages and avoiding unnecessary complexity.
