# Memory Tool Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Foundation)

### 1.1 Create Memory Tool Structure

- **File**: `packages/kuuzuki/src/tool/memory.ts`
- **Dependencies**: Zod schema, Tool interface, File operations
- **Core Functions**:
  - Read/write .agentrc file
  - Parse and validate JSON structure
  - Basic CRUD operations for rules

### 1.2 Define Memory Schema

- **Rule Structure**:
  ```typescript
  interface Rule {
    id: string
    text: string
    category: "critical" | "preferred" | "contextual" | "deprecated"
    filePath?: string
    reason?: string
    createdAt: string
    lastUsed?: string
    usageCount: number
  }
  ```

### 1.3 Update .agentrc Schema

- **Current**: `"rules": string[]`
- **New**: `"rules": { [category]: Rule[] }` + `"ruleMetadata": RuleMetadata`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Migration function for existing string-based rules

### 1.4 Register Tool

- Add `MemoryTool` to `packages/kuuzuki/src/tool/registry.ts`
- Ensure it's available in all tool contexts

## Phase 2: Basic Operations (MVP)

### 2.1 Implement Core Actions

- **Add Rule**: `memory({ action: "add", rule: "text", category: "critical" })`
- **List Rules**: `memory({ action: "list", category?: "critical" })`
- **Remove Rule**: `memory({ action: "remove", rule: "rule-id" })`
- **Update Rule**: `memory({ action: "update", rule: "rule-id", newText: "..." })`

### 2.2 File Path Linking

- **Link Documentation**: `memory({ action: "link", rule: "pattern-name", filePath: "docs/PATTERNS.md" })`
- **Validation**: Ensure linked files exist
- **Auto-reading**: When rule is referenced, automatically read linked file

### 2.3 Error Handling & Validation

- Schema validation for all operations
- Conflict detection (duplicate rules)
- Permission handling for .agentrc modifications
- Rollback capability for failed operations

## Phase 3: Smart Features (Enhancement)

### 3.1 Rule Intelligence

- **Context Detection**: Automatically suggest relevant rules based on current operation
- **Usage Tracking**: Track which rules are actually applied/helpful
- **Conflict Resolution**: Detect contradictory rules and suggest resolutions

### 3.2 Session Memory

- **Session Tracking**: Remember rules learned/applied in current session
- **Context Preservation**: Link rules to specific scenarios/problems
- **Learning Patterns**: Identify frequently needed rules

### 3.3 Documentation Integration

- **Auto-linking**: Suggest documentation files for complex rules
- **Content Analysis**: Parse linked files to extract relevant patterns
- **Sync Detection**: Warn when linked files are modified

## Phase 4: Advanced Capabilities (Future)

### 4.1 Rule Analytics

- **Usage Statistics**: Which rules are most/least effective
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify emerging patterns in rule creation
- **Cleanup Suggestions**: Recommend deprecated/unused rules for removal

### 4.2 Team Collaboration

- **Rule Sharing**: Export/import rule sets between projects
- **Version Control**: Track rule changes over time
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent rule modifications

### 4.3 AI Integration

- **Smart Categorization**: Auto-categorize rules based on content
- **Rule Generation**: Suggest rules based on code patterns
- **Context Awareness**: Dynamically load relevant rules based on current task

## Implementation Order

### Week 1: Foundation

1. Create memory tool file structure
2. Implement basic schema and validation
3. Add to tool registry
4. Create migration for existing .agentrc files

### Week 2: Core Operations

1. Implement add/list/remove/update actions
2. Add file path linking capability
3. Basic error handling and validation
4. Write comprehensive tests

### Week 3: Smart Features

1. Context detection and rule suggestions
2. Usage tracking and analytics
3. Session memory implementation
4. Documentation integration

### Week 4: Polish & Integration

1. Advanced conflict detection
2. Performance optimization
3. Documentation and examples
4. Integration testing with existing tools

## Technical Considerations

### Data Storage

- **Primary**: .agentrc file (JSON)
- **Backup**: Session storage for temporary rules
- **Cache**: In-memory rule index for performance

### Performance

- **Lazy Loading**: Only load rules when needed
- **Caching**: Cache parsed .agentrc in memory
- **Batch Operations**: Support multiple rule operations in single call

### Security

- **Validation**: All rule content must be validated
- **Permissions**: Respect existing file permission system
- **Sanitization**: Prevent injection of malicious content

### Compatibility

- **Backward Compatibility**: Support existing string-based rules
- **Migration Path**: Smooth upgrade from current format
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation if memory tool fails

## Success Metrics

### Functionality

- [ ] Can add/remove/update rules via tool calls
- [ ] Rules persist across sessions
- [ ] Documentation linking works correctly
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing .agentrc usage

### Usability

- [ ] AI agents naturally use memory tool during conversations
- [ ] Rules become more relevant over time
- [ ] Reduced repetition of common patterns
- [ ] Clear audit trail of rule changes

### Performance

- [ ] Tool operations complete in <100ms
- [ ] No noticeable impact on existing tool performance
- [ ] Memory usage remains reasonable
- [ ] File I/O is optimized

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing the memory tool while maintaining system stability and ensuring the feature adds real value to the AI agent workflow.
