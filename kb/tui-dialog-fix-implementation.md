# TUI Dialog Fix Implementation Summary

## Problem
The TUI display was being corrupted when dialogs appeared during chat interactions (tool permissions, yes/no questions, text inputs). The issue was caused by code using `console.log()` and `@clack/prompts` library, which write directly to the terminal and bypass the Bubbletea TUI framework.

## Solution Implemented (0.1.0)

### 1. TUI Mode Detection
- Added `KUUZUKI_TUI_MODE=true` environment variable in `cli/cmd/tui.ts`
- Set when TUI starts to indicate terminal UI is active

### 2. TUI-Safe Prompt Wrapper
Created `util/tui-safe-prompt.ts` that:
- Detects if running in TUI mode
- Returns safe defaults when in TUI mode instead of showing prompts
- Passes through to normal prompts when not in TUI mode
- Wraps all @clack/prompts functions: confirm, select, text, password, multiselect
- Provides TUI-safe logging functions that use the logger instead of console

### 3. Updated All Prompt Usage
Updated files to use TUI-safe wrapper:
- `cli/cmd/mcp.ts` - MCP tool selection
- `cli/cmd/auth.ts` - Authentication prompts
- `cli/cmd/upgrade.ts` - Upgrade confirmation
- `cli/cmd/github.ts` - GitHub integration prompts
- `cli/cmd/agent.ts` - Agent selection

### 4. Default Behaviors in TUI Mode
- confirm() → returns false (deny by default for safety)
- select() → returns first option or initial value
- text() → returns empty string or default value
- password() → returns empty string
- multiselect() → returns empty array or initial values
- console.log() → uses logger instead

## Testing Instructions
1. Start TUI: `bun dev`
2. Trigger scenarios that would show prompts:
   - Tool approvals
   - Any interactive prompts
3. Verify no terminal corruption occurs
4. Verify operations are safely denied/defaulted

## Future Improvements (0.2.0)
- Replace this temporary fix with proper inline TUI dialogs
- Implement the inline message components created earlier
- Create a proper dialog/interaction manager
- Remove the need for TUI-safe wrapper

## Known Limitations
- All prompts are automatically denied/defaulted in TUI mode
- No user interaction possible for prompts when TUI is active
- This is a temporary fix until proper inline dialogs are implemented

## Implementation Details
The fix works by:
1. Preventing any direct terminal writes when TUI is active
2. Using the logger for output instead of console
3. Returning sensible defaults for all prompt types
4. Maintaining normal behavior when not in TUI mode

This ensures the TUI display remains intact while providing a path forward for proper dialog integration.
